**Little Innovators**



"Little Innovators" Slogan Writing Competition was organized for the students at Johns Senior School. The important guideline for the contest was that the Slogan(Case insensitive) should contain a string where the sum of occurrences of the same character in it is equal to the sum of the numbers of occurrences of unique characters in the string. Create a Java application to help the event organizers to determine whether the submitted Slogans adhere to the given condition. 

Note: 

Slogan must contain alphabets and white space otherwise, print "Invalid slogan" and terminate the program 

Output a single line containing "All the guidelines are satisfied for <slogan>" if the string satisfies the guideline given above or "<slogan> does not satisfy the guideline" otherwise. 

Ignore the spaces between words 

 

Please do not use System.exit(0) to terminate the program 

 

Sample Input 1: 

Wifi Pizza Sleep 

Sample Output 1: 

All the guidelines are satisfied for Wifi Pizza Sleep 

Explanation: 

In the above Slogan, sum of occurrence of the same characters is 7(i,i,i,z,z,e,e) and the sum of occurrence of unique character is 7(W,f,P,a,S,l,p).â€¯Since both are equal, print "All the guidelines are satisfied for Wifi Pizza Sleep" 

 

Sample Input 2: 

Think different 

Sample Output 2: 

Think different does not satisfy the guideline 

Explanation: 

In the above Slogan, the sum of the occurrence of the same character is 10 and the sum of occurrence of unique character is 4 and 10 is not equal to 4. So print "Think different does not satisfy the guideline" 

 

Sample Input 3: 

Friend in @Need 

Sample Output 3: 

Invalid slogan
